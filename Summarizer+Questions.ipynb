In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

            " Hello and welcome to the course, Food Toxicology. My name is Professor Greg Muller and I'm the instructor for the course. I'd like to first welcome all the students that have undertaken this particular course of study. We hope that this course provides you with a good sound structural basis for an understanding and enhancing your knowledge in food toxicology. When we talk about food, we're talking about one of the most intimate relationships that we have with our environment. If you go back in history, you see that in fact, man has always questioned or challenged this particular interaction with his food system. This food system has presented many challenges in terms of potential or actual toxicosis. And in fact, through our history, we have found what is good to eat and what perhaps is poisonous or bad to eat.\n"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
